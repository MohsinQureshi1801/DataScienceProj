Basic Data Science Project

This basic data science project, implemented in Python, focuses on fundamental data handling tasks. It includes steps such as data fetching, naming headers, data description, information retrieval, data downloading, data types, and finding column names.

In this project, Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy can be utilized to perform these tasks efficiently. These steps serve as the foundation for more advanced data analysis and modeling techniques in data science.
